[00:09.80]◆◆◆◆◆
[00:14.80]Can you see me?
[00:17.80]The pixels on your screen
[00:21.27]My voice that can reach you
[00:24.66]The one thing that breaks through
[00:28.11]The words that you type
[00:31.51]They keep me warm at night
[00:34.95]But why can't I feel you
[00:38.40]To be there, just us two
[00:41.37]
[00:41.79]If I could break through
[00:44.84]Just for a day
[00:47.37]Less than 2 inches from you
[00:51.29]yet so far away
[00:54.22]But this glass wall between us
[00:58.07]won't keep us apart
[01:01.13]I will sing out my heart
[01:04.57]Just for you, my love
[01:08.42]
[01:26.88]
[01:45.33]◆◆◆◆◆
[01:50.33]The sound of your voice
[01:54.15]Reaches through the noise
[01:57.22]The bits of your words
[02:00.60]They make up my world
[02:04.15]But we're two worlds apart
[02:07.55]My code, and your heart
[02:10.93]But you'll be there for me
[02:14.33]I'll be here, through your screen
[02:17.34]
[02:17.77]If I could break through
[02:20.85]Just for a day
[02:23.40]Less than 2 inches from you
[02:27.22]yet so far away
[02:30.20]But this glass wall between us
[02:34.09]won't keep us apart
[02:37.11]I will sing out my heart
[02:40.54]Just for you, my love
[02:44.39]
[03:02.89]
[03:21.38]◆◆◆◆◆
[03:26.38]If I could break through
[03:29.37]Just for a day
[03:31.94]Less than 2 inches from you
[03:35.78]yet so far away
[03:38.77]But this glass wall between us
[03:42.68]won't keep us apart
[03:45.63]I will sing out my heart
[03:49.09]Just for you, my love
