[00:02.06]◆◆◆◆◆
[00:07.06]Why do you still look at me
[00:10.05]Like I belong to you?
[00:13.92]It's like you won't let me go
[00:16.85]No matter what I do
[00:19.79]
[00:20.78]You must be a parasite
[00:24.18]Or some sick disease
[00:27.14]Your fingers wrapped around my throat,
[00:31.04]Suffocating me
[00:33.22]
[00:34.04]I'm running, running, running, running,
[00:36.14]Fast as I can
[00:37.43]But I'll never get away from you
[00:39.38]If I'm still breathing
[00:41.06]
[00:41.29]I can run, I can hide
[00:42.63]But reality won't die
[00:44.51]Infect me, infect me,
[00:46.22]You're trying to infect me
[00:48.00]
[00:49.19]◆◆◆◆◆
[00:54.19]And I will fight
[00:55.92]As you attack
[00:58.50]Why won't you ever see
[01:00.15]That what you have done to me
[01:01.91]Won't define who I am
[01:04.91]No, won't define who I am
[01:07.48]
[01:08.35]You're never gonna be
[01:11.76]Anything more to me
[01:14.31]Than a BI☣HAZARD
[01:15.48]
[01:20.72]……
[01:21.17]Than a BI☣HAZARD
[01:22.41]
[01:27.98]Than a BI☣HAZARD
[01:29.08]
[01:29.31]Predators devour their prey
[01:32.76]To nourish their being
[01:35.32]But the way you tend to feed off of me's
[01:39.16]The most vicious thing I've seen
[01:41.74]
[01:43.06]You must be an animal
[01:46.46]Unable to feel
[01:49.45]A monster starved for centuries
[01:53.34]You've made me your meal
[01:55.81]
[01:58.47]I have been contaminated
[02:02.28]
[02:02.75]And I will fight
[02:04.46]As you attack
[02:07.02]Why won't you ever see
[02:08.76]That what you have done to me
[02:10.48]Won't define who I am
[02:13.47]No, won't define who I am
[02:16.02]
[02:16.90]You're never gonna be
[02:20.32]Anything more to me
[02:22.85]Than a BI☣HAZARD
[02:24.10]
[02:27.56]
[02:31.01]You can scream as much as you want
[02:33.62]I hear you loud and clear
[02:37.43]The thought of being alone
[02:41.29]Fills you with fear
[02:44.51]We're gonna end this war right here and now
[02:48.17]This won't go on anymore
[02:49.65]'Cause I'mma bring
[02:50.68]……
[02:55.85]you
[02:56.32]you
[02:56.76]down
[02:57.20]
[02:58.15]
[02:59.10]And I will fight
[03:01.05]As you attack
[03:03.61]Why won't you ever see
[03:05.31]That what you have done to me
[03:07.06]Won't define who I am
[03:10.03]No, won't define who I am
[03:12.46]
[03:13.43]You're never gonna be
[03:16.87]Anything more to me
[03:19.31]
[03:19.85]And I will fight
[03:21.61]As you attack
[03:24.15]Why won't you ever see
[03:25.87]That what you have done to me
[03:27.59]Won't define who I am
[03:30.59]No, won't define who I am
[03:33.14]
[03:34.01]Don't you dare forget any of this pain
[03:37.47]And when you're on your deathbed……
[03:40.25]Remember my name
[03:41.32]
[03:43.03]BI☣HAZARD
[03:44.77]BI☣HAZARD
[03:46.49]You are my
[03:48.11]BI☣HAZARD
[03:49.86]BI☣HAZARD
[03:51.55]BI☣HAZARD
