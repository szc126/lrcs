[00:-0.50]
[00:47.50]Just a tiny piece I have come to find
[00:53.53]Goes a long, long way to change my mind
[00:59.51]Right from the start I have always known
[01:05.55]That the day would come when I’d end up alone
[01:11.09]
[01:11.24]So…
[01:12.15]
[01:12.67]Don’t speak
[01:15.66]Don’t cry
[01:18.28]‘til you say
[01:21.28]Your goodbye
[01:23.08]Cause
[01:24.31]At the end
[01:27.28]When it’s time for you to go
[01:31.89]I want you to know
[01:35.20]
[01:36.36]For every time I cried I laughed a little
[01:41.61]For every time it hurt I smiled a little
[01:47.51]Even when things were bad
[01:50.59]I was never really sad
[01:53.61]Now I’ll say “good-bye”
[01:56.60]To the love that I had
[01:59.31]
[02:10.82]There’s a tiny piece I have kept alive
[02:17.66]So when that day comes you won’t see me cry
[02:23.50]When it’s over, then I will let it die
[02:29.55]With the knowledge that it once was mine
[02:35.13]
[02:35.26]So
[02:36.05]
[02:36.65]Don’t say
[02:39.73]A word
[02:42.37]Cause I know
[02:45.33]It’s over
[02:47.08]And
[02:48.30]At the end
[02:51.32]When it’s time
[02:52.87]For you to go
[02:55.76]I want you to know
[02:59.21]
[02:59.52]For every time I cried I laughed a little
[03:05.53]For every time it hurt I smiled a little
[03:11.46]Even when things were bad
[03:14.57]I was never really sad
[03:17.50]Now I’ll say “good-bye”
[03:20.48]To the love that I had
[03:23.21]
[03:48.70]Don’t speak
[03:51.72]Don’t cry
[03:54.29]‘til I say
[03:57.47]My goodbye
[03:59.11]Cause
[04:00.39]At the end
[04:03.31]When it’s time
[04:04.93]For me to go
[04:07.82]I want you to know
[04:11.25]
[04:13.71]For every time I cried I laughed a little
[04:19.05]For every time it hurt I smiled a little
[04:25.14]Even when things were bad
[04:28.03]I was never really sad
[04:31.14]Now I’ll say “good-bye”
[04:34.08]To the love that I had
[04:36.69]
[04:37.08]Now I’ll say “good-bye” to the love that I had…
[04:42.77]
[04:43.06]Now I’ll say “good-bye” to the love that I had…
